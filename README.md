# Classification
** Goal : **
Predict whether the patient has heart disease or not. This is a binary result. We will experiment with different classification models and see which
one yields the most accuracy.

** Question : **
Can a classification model predict whether the patient has heart disease or not ?

** Data Description: **

is determined by 14 features (X):

age: age in years
sex: male,  female
cp: chest pain type
trestbps: resting blood pressure
chol: serum cholesterol
fbs: fasting blood sugar
restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
exang: exercise induced angina
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca: number of major vessels
thal: number of defect type
target: disease, no disease
